# Covid19-in-India_Tableau

A Tableau dashboard on COVID-19 in India could provide a comprehensive visual representation of various aspects of the pandemic's impact on the country. Here's a potential description of what such a dashboard could include:

Overview: The dashboard would start with an overview section presenting key metrics such as total confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths. This section could feature a combination of numerical summaries and visualizations like line charts or bar graphs to show trends over time.
Geographical Distribution: A map visualization would show the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases across different states and regions of India. Users could interact with the map to drill down into specific areas and view detailed statistics for each location.
Trend Analysis: This section would delve deeper into the trends of COVID-19 cases, focusing on metrics like daily new cases, testing rates, positivity rates, and vaccination progress. Line charts or area charts could be used to visualize these trends over time, allowing users to identify patterns and fluctuations.
Demographic Analysis: Another aspect of the dashboard could be dedicated to demographic analysis, highlighting the age and gender distribution of COVID-19 cases, as well as any disparities in infection rates among different demographic groups.
